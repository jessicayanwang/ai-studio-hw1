Hi everyone, I'm Jessica! I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Data Science at Harvard, with a background in Data Science and Mathematics from the University of Toronto. My interests range from Machine Learning to Technical Sales, and I recently earned an "Honorable Mention" in the Harvard-Duke AI/ML Global Hackathon. Can't wait to connect and learn together!
